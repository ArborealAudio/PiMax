# README

To install, copy the plugin bundles/files to the desired system location.

By default for user-specific installation, this is ~/.vst3, ~/.vst, etc,
and for system installation: /usr/lib/vst3 or /usr/local/lib/vst3, etc...

If you want the factory presets, you should copy the 'Factory' dir to
~/.config/'Arboreal Audio'/#PLUGIN#/Presets/Factory
